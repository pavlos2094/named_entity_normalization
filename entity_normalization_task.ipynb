        "This is an admittedly naive approach to tackle the problem. Ideally, information mined from a knowledge base should be used in order to tackle the problem as an NEL task and link entities together (e.g. using Spotlight of DBpedia). However, the problem can quickly get much more complicated, as many entities might not be having a relevant match (or even one at all). That also depends on the effiency of the NER tool used in the first place.\n",
